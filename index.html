<h2>The story</h2>
<p>
    Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. 
That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. 
They said, <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. 
This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <strong><q class="farmer"> Maybe</q></strong> 
The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, 
and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villagers">isn't that lucky. 
What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>
The farmer again said, <strong><q class="farmer"> Maybe.</q></strong> </p>

<p>
The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, 
he was thrown and broke his leg. 
The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that's too <em class="bad"> bad</em>,</q> 
and the farmer responded
, <strong><q class="farmer"> Maybe.</q></strong> 
The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people 
into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
 Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers">Isn't that great!</q>
 Again, he said, <strong><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></strong>
 </p>

 <p>
The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, 
and it's really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is 
<em class="good"> good </em> or <em class="bad"> bad</em> â€” because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune
; or, you never know what will be the consequences of<em class="good"> good </em> fortune.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><em class="good"> Good </em>and <em class="bad"> Bad</em> are just one perspective. <br> 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana"target="_blank" title="It works too!">Bananas</a> are<em class="good"> good </em>for monkeys, 
but monkeys are not <em class="good"> good </em> for bananas. <br>
Let's not make a big deal out of it...
